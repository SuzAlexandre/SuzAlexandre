- 👋 Hi, I’m @SuzAlexandre
- 👀 I’m interested in data sciences, therefore I learned a bit more of Matlab at first place for engineering school, and work more on Python and SQL systems at the moment. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more python adn Java for data science applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python for data Science and application developments (PyQT, Tkinter). I would need as well to work more on Java to get a real programming language.
